This is my final student project - a web-based nursing handover for a private hospital. 
I created a set of dummy data (SQL database) to test and evidence that the patient data could be pulled from the PAS.
The project was designed to resolve the real world problem of paper-based handovers and provide an electronic
version which pulled accurate data from the PAS instead of being input by administrators. 
It also provided a means for nursing staff to review and add patient observations.
This provides access for all nursing staff to monitor and record patient activity across a ward easily 
I was limited for time but I had ideas of further development, such as a way to upload relevant documents 
that are in paper form - such as blood results - to individual entries for instant review by a doctor.
I also wanted to show that the system could be made secure with login access.
